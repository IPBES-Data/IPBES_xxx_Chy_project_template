## Build No: `r build`

%The BuidNo is automatically increased by one each time the report is rendered. It is used to indicate different renderings when the version stays the same%.

## Introduction
This is an example report to illustrate how these can be linked in the `Readme.md`.
The Metadata in the YAML header is used to create the metadata for the report and needs to be updated accordingly.

Data from the YAML frontmatter can be accessed in the report using e.g. `r rmarkdown::metadata$version` for the version.
